- More work on version resolution algorithm: filter older versions for packages with no interdependencies. So if a package does not depend on other packages, nor is a dependency of other packages, we can safely remove all but the latest version.
- Add spec setup for 10 packages, each with 5 versions installed and interdependencies.
- Add spec with circular dependency: a@0.1 => b@0.2 => c@0.3 => a@0.1
- Add spec with invalid circular dependency: a@0.1 => b@0.2 => c@0.3 => a@0.3
