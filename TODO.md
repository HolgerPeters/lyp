- Check that install self works correctly. Ideally add a spec
- Refuse to install self if `which lyp` = "~/.lypack/bin/lyp"
- Switch from commander to thor or maybe find something better?
- When installing without a version specifier, instead of installing head (of master), install the highest version found in tags. Only if no numerical versions are found, install head.
