# lyp - The Lilypond Swiss Army Knife

Easily manage multiple versions of [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/), install packages with support code and fonts, improve your score-preparation workflow and even improve lilypond's performance!

__Code reuse__: lyp lets you install [packages] that act as Lilypond code libraries and can be used to enhance your Lilypond files with additional functionality. Packages can depend on other packages. Lyp resolves both direct and transitive package dependencies, and automatically selects the correct version to use for each package.

__No hassle Lilypond installation__: With lyp you can also install any version of Lilypond on your machine with a single command, without having to visit the Lilypond website, clicking a link and then copying files around. In addition, lyp lets you switch between multiple versions of Lilypond and always keep your machine up to date with the latest version.

__Tools for power users__: with lyp you can [benchmark](documentation#lyp-benchmark) and compare the performance of multiple versions of Lilypond, [flatten](#lyp-flatten) include files, automatically recompile [modified source files](#lyp-watch), and [automatically install](#lyp-compile) package dependencies or any required version of Lilypond.
